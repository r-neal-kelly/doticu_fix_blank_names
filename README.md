# Fix Blank Names
Just a small SKSE plugin that periodically restores all reference names that have become blank. No scripts, just plain super-fast C++! Comes with a .ini file with a handful of settings.

### Requirements
- Skyrim SE 1.5.97
- SKSE 2.0.17+

### Thanks
- LeonTubrok at NexusMods for the suggestion!
