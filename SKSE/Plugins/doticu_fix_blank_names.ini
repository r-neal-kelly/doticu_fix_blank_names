; one would simply need to quick save and quick load to be rid of the blank name, else set this to 0.

; Desireable if you use a mod that specifically requires blank names.
; Only aliases will be modified, and thus blank names will be prevented but not removed in the event one occurs.
; If you use this, there is the rare chance that you will still get a blank name that should have been prevented,
; especially if your update_interval is large. I recommend selecting only_fix_blank_names_on_load_game instead.
